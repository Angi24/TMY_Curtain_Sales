            `Effective at keeping out both drafts in the winter and heat in the summer.
        The curtains can be used on a curtain rod or a curtain track.
        You can hang the curtains on a curtain rod through the hidden tabs or with rings and hooks.
        The heading tape has the same color as the curtain so it looks neat from the back as well.
        Blackout curtains blocks light from shining through and completely darkens your room.
        The heading tape makes it easy for you to create pleats using RIKTIG curtain hooks.`,
